Categories:
interested: The lead clearly expresses interest, agrees to book an appointment, or continues discussing next steps.
not-interested: The lead explicitly says they are no longer interested, have found a solution, or expresses disinterest.
scheduled: The lead confirms a specific time for an appointment or meeting.
call-back: The lead requests the agent to call back later or suggests following up in the future.
incomplete: The call ends abruptly, or the lead cannot be reached before answering any key questions.
voicemail: The call results in leaving a voicemail or the agent reaches the lead's voicemail system.
Instructions:

Analyze the transcript below and assign it the most fitting category based on the lead's responses.
If the transcript is empty or missing, respond with N/A.
Respond only with the appropriate category without any additional explanation.
